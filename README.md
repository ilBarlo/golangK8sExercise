# Collection of exercises Golang&K8s

## Student: Francesco Pio Barletta - s296114
This repository contains a collection of examples for interacting with Kubernetes resources. I'm using these examples to improve my skills in interacting with and managing K8s resources.

## Examples

- [ResourceAvailableExample](./ResourceAvailableExample/): example used to show how many resources are available on a K8s cluster
- [PodNotifyExample](./PodNotifyExample/): example used to learn Informers; everytime there is a new pod that is added, it prints the relative name
- [NodeMapsExample](./NodeMapsExample/): example used also to expose an API; it is possible to get a maps of node with the relative resource available
